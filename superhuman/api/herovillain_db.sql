He is nearly unstoppable. However, Superman does have one weakness, Kryptonite.', 'Superman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, high school students living in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1933. They sold Superman to Detective Comics, the future DC Comics, in 1938. Superman debuted in Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June 1938) and subsequently appeared in various radio serials, newspaper strips, television programs, films, and video games. With this success, Superman helped to create the superhero archetype and establish its primacy within the American comic book.[2] The character is also referred to by such epithets as the Big Blue Boy Scout, the Man of Steel, the Man of Tomorrow, and the Last Son of Krypton.[3]\nThe origin story of Superman relates that he was born Kal-El on the planet Krypton, before being rocketed to Earth as an infant by his scientist father Jor-El, moments before Krypton`s destruction. Discovered and adopted by a farm couple from Kansas, the child is raised as Clark Kent and imbued with a strong moral compass. Early in his childhood, he displays various superhuman abilities, which, upon reaching maturity, he resolves to use for the benefit of humanity through a \"Superman\" identity.\nSuperman resides and operates in the fictional American city of Metropolis. As Clark Kent, he is a journalist for the Daily Planet, a Metropolis newspaper. Superman`s love interest is Lois Lane, and his archenemy is the supervillain Lex Luthor. A close ally of Batman and Wonder Woman, he is typically depicted as a member of the Justice League. Like other characters in the DC Universe, several alternative versions of Superman have been characterized over the years.\nSuperman`s appearance is distinctive and iconic; he usually wears a blue costume with a red-and-yellow emblem on the chest, consisting of the letter S in a shield shape, and a red cape. This shield is used in many media to symbolize the character. Superman is widely considered an American cultural icon.[2][4][5][6] He has fascinated scholars, with cultural theorists, commentators, and critics alike exploring the character`s role and impact in the United States and worldwide. The character`s ownership has often been the subject of dispute, with Siegel and Shuster twice suing for the return of rights. The character has been portrayed in many media adaptations as well, including films, television series, and video games. Several actors have depicted Superman in motion pictures and TV series including Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Tom Welling, Brandon Routh, Henry Cavill, and Tyler Hoechlin.', 'In January 1933, Cleveland high school student[7] Jerry Siegel wrote a short story, illustrated by his friend and classmate Joe Shuster, titled \"The Reign of the Superman\", which Siegel self-published in his fanzine, Science Fiction. The titular character is a vagrant who gains vast psychic powers from an experimental drug and uses them maliciously for profit and amusement, only to lose them and become a vagrant again, ashamed that he will be remembered only as a villain.[8] Siegel`s fanzine did not sell well. Siegel and Shuster shifted to making comic strips, which they self-published in a book they called Popular Comics. The pair dreamed of becoming professional authors and believed that syndicated newspaper strips offered more lucrative and stable work than pulp magazines. The art quality standards were also lower, making them more accessible to the inexperienced Shuster.[9]\nIn early 1933 or in 1934,[10] Siegel developed a new character, also named Superman, but now a heroic character, which Siegel felt would be more marketable.[11] This first prototype of Superman had no fantastic abilities and wore casual clothing. Siegel and Shuster often compared this version to Slam Bradley, a comics character they created in 1936.[12][13]\nSiegel shared his idea with Shuster and they decided to turn it into a comic strip. The first publisher they solicited was Humor Publishing in Chicago, after having read one of their comic books, Detective Dan.[14][15][16] A representative of Humor Publishing was due to visit Cleveland on a business trip and so Siegel and Shuster hastily put together a comic story titled \"The Superman\" and presented it to the publisher.[17] Although Humor showed interest, it pulled out of the comics business before any book deal could be made.[18] Siegel believed publishers kept rejecting them because he and Shuster were young and unknown, so he looked for an established artist to replace Shuster.[19] When Siegel told Shuster what he was doing, Shuster reacted by burning their rejected Superman comic, sparing only the cover.[20][21]\nSiegel solicited multiple artists[19][22] and in 1934 Russell Keaton,[22] who worked on the Buck Rogers comic strip, responded. In nine sample strips Keaton produced based on Siegel`s treatment, the Superman character further evolves: In the distant future, when Earth is on the verge of exploding due to \"giant cataclysms\", the last surviving man sends his child back in time to the year 1935, where he is adopted by Sam and Molly Kent. The boy exhibits superhuman strength and bulletproof skin, and the Kents teach the child, whom they name Clark, to use his powers for good.[23][24] However, the newspaper syndicates rejected their work and Keaton abandoned the project.[25]\nSiegel and Shuster reconciled and resumed developing Superman. The character became an alien from the planet Krypton with the now-familiar costume: tights with an \"S\" on the chest, over-shorts, and a cape.[26][27][28] They made Clark Kent a journalist who pretends to be timid, and introduced his colleague Lois Lane, who is attracted to the bold and mighty Superman, but does not realize he and Kent are the same person.[29]\nSiegel and Shuster entered the comics field professionally in 1935, producing detective and adventure stories for the New York-based comic-book publisher National Allied Publications. Although National expressed interest in Superman,[30] Siegel and Shuster wanted to sell Superman as a syndicated comic strip, but the newspaper syndicates all turned them down.[31] Max Gaines, who worked at McClure Newspaper Syndicate, suggested they show their work to Detective Comics (which had recently bought out National Allied).[32] Siegel recalled, In March 1938, Siegel and Shuster sold all rights to the character to Detective Comics, Inc.[33] for $130 (ten dollars per page, the equivalent of $2,200 when adjusted for inflation).[34][35] It was the company`s policy to buy the full rights to the characters it published.[36] By this time, they had resigned themselves that Superman would never be a success, and with this deal they would at least see their character finally published.[37]', 'http://localhost/heroandvillain/superhuman/api/images/0_Superman.png', 'Clark Joseph Kent', '6` 2\"', '235 Lbs', 'Superman possesses the powers of flight, superhuman strength, x-ray vision, heat vision, cold breath, super-speed, enhanced hearing, and nigh-invulnerability.

In his first appearance, Blonsky became a large scaly humanoid even stronger than the Hulk.[5] In accordance with Lee`s wishes, the character defeated the Hulk in their first battle.[6]. The character has been featured in a number of Marvel titles, gradually shifting from unthinking, savage brute,[6] to master schemer,[7] to tortured soul,[8] and finally repentant villain and occasional defender of the weak[9] before being killed in battle by the Red Hulk.[10]', 'The Abomination reappears when summoned by a coven of witches to briefly battle the cosmic hero the Silver Surfer[13] and summons Thor (via an absent Stranger`s technology) to aid him in escaping the Stranger`s laboratory world. Thor frees the Abomination and the other captives, but, on discovering they are all evil, uses his mystic hammer Mjolnir to time travel several hours into the past to undo his mistake. After defeating the Abomination and placing the Abomination in prison, Thor departs.[7] When the Hulk is defeated by the alien Xeron the Star Slayer (who is in New York City hunting a giant creature called Klaatu) and brought aboard a space vessel, the Abomination is revealed to be First Mate of the alien crew. When the captain of the vessel directs Xeron and the crew to battle Klaatu in space, the Hulk and the Abomination are thrown from the vessel and battle until the pair are drawn into Earth`s orbit and separated.[14]', 'http://localhost/heroandvillain/superhuman/api/images/0_Abomination.png', 'Emil Blonsky', '6` 8\"', '980 Lbs', 'The Abomination is similar to the Hulk in terms of strength, stamina, speed and durability, and the ability to regenerate.

Initially, the Abomination is twice as strong as the Hulk, but unlike the Hulk his strength does not increase/decrease in proportion to level of anger, with the result that the Hulk is able to gain an advantage over the Abomination if the fight takes a sufficient amount of time for his anger to increase.', 'Hulk', 'jong', 'vtt', '2021-11-21 12:18:42'),

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength, and his alter ego Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, the two existing as personalities independent and resenting of the other.\nFollowing his accidental exposure to gamma rays during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will, often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner`s civilian life. The Hulk`s level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other personalities based on Banner`s fractured psyche, from a mindless, destructive force, to a brilliant warrior, or genius scientist in his own right. Despite both Hulk and Banner`s desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast, including Banner`s lover Betty Ross, his friend Rick Jones, his cousin She-Hulk, sons Hiro-Kala and Skaar, and his co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others.\nLee stated that the Hulk`s creation was inspired by a combination of Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.[3] Although the Hulk`s coloration has varied throughout the character`s publication history, the most usual color is green. He has two main catchphrases: \"Hulk is strongest one there is!\" and the better-known \"HULK SMASH!\", which has founded the basis for numerous pop culture memes.\nOne of the most iconic characters in popular culture,[4][5] the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in a number of media.

(909, 'Spider-Man', 'hero', 'Spider-Man has spider-like abilities including superhuman strength and the ability to cling to most surfaces. He is also extremely agile and has amazing reflexes. Spider-Man also has a “spider sense,” that warns him of impending danger. Spider-Man has supplemented his powers with technology.', 'Spider-Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crime-fighter. Spider-Man`s creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention, which he calls \"web-shooters\", and react to danger quickly with his \"spider-sense\", enabling him to combat his foes.\nWhen Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, the high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man`s secret identity and with whose \"self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness\" young readers could relate.[8] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that \"with great power there must also come great responsibility\"u2014a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben.\nMarvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is titled The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character has developed from shy, nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2010s, he joins the Avengers, Marvel`s flagship superhero team. Spider-Man`s nemesis Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012u20132014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die.[9] Separately, Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O`Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker`s supposed death. Miles is later brought into mainstream continuity, where he works alongside Peter.\nSpider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.[10] As Marvel`s flagship character and company mascot, he has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated and live action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and in a series of films. The character was first portrayed in live action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a The Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977.[11] In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire (2002u20132007), Andrew Garfield (2012u20132014),[12] and Tom Holland, who has portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2016. Reeve Carney starred as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.[13] Spider-Man has been well received as a superhero and comic book character, and he is often ranked as one of the most popular comic book characters of all time, alongside DC Comics` most famous superheroes, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman.', 'In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.[15]:1 In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider (see also The Spider`s Web and The Spider Returns) as a great influence,[14]:130 and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wallu2014adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.[note 1] Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with \"boy\", Lee says he chose \"Spider-Man\" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name \"Spider-Boy\" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.[16] At that time Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character`s approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman`s objections.[note 2] Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for that single issue, #15 (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962).[17] In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be cancelled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man.[16] While this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that \"The Spiderman [sic] ... will appear every month in Amazing.\"[17][18]\nRegardless, Lee received Goodman`s approval for the name Spider-Man and the \"ordinary teen\" concept, and approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby \"immediately sat down for a story conference\", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages.[19] Steve Ditko would be the inker.[note 3] When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, \"I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badlyu2014it just wasn`t the character I wanted; it was too heroic\".[19]:12 Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:\nOne of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn`t have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn`t sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character`s face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....[20]\nAlthough the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko`s cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.[17] As Lee explained in 2010, \"I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack`s covers.\"[21]\nIn an early recollection of the character`s creation, Ditko described his and Lee`s contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): \"Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal.\"[22] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was \"almost nil\", he and Ditko had \"worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands.\"[19]:14', 'http://localhost/heroandvillain/superhuman/api/images/0_Spider-Man.png', 'Peter Parker', '6` 2\"', '209 Lbs', 'Superhuman strength, agility, endurance, ability to stick to and climb walls and other surfaces, uses self-designed web-shooters allowing him to fire and swing from sticky webs, special \"Spider-Sense\" warns of incoming danger, genius intellect specializing in chemistry and invention.', 'Doctor Octopus, The Green Goblin, Kingpin, Carnage, Venom, Mysterio, Vulture, Sandman', 'jong', 'vtt', '2021-11-21 11:39:02');
